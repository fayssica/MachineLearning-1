# Get history weather
This code can help us to get the history  weather information of a city.

We use the website: `http://lishi.tianqi.com`

Just change the city's url in the code like this: `http://lishi.tianqi.com/beijing/index.html`

And run the code, then we can get the history weather of Beijing. 

It will be saved in "all_weather.csv".
